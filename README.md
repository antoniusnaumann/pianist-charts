# Pianist Charts
A beautiful chart library for Jetpack Compose (Android) and Compose for Desktop which supports Material 3 themeing.

## About
### Yet another chart library?
Yes! Because unlike most available chart libraries, Pianist aims to focus on styling and themeing to bring beautiful charts to your dashboard apps written in Compose, supporting all the latest and greatest features of Material 3 like Material You dynamic color out of the box.

### Why the name?
For every software tool, there is this a mediocre joke game going on with the tools names. For Compose libraries, Google started this with the [Accompanist](https://github.com/google/accompanist) library. So naturally, I had the urge to continue this musical reference game for this library. I found the name Pianist fitting, because like a pianist presents a composition to its audience with in their style, the pianist chart library provides charts to present data in a human understandable way with a focus on fitting the Material 3 style guideline.
